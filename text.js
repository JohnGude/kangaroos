"<h4>16personalities: Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)</h4>" +
"<p>The results of this test were relatively accurate, it allows me to understand my view of the world against others. This in turn allows me to interact and see the social interactions I have viewed from a different person and adjust as required to accommodate the connection. The test will influence me in that I will need to accommodate others understanding, allowing other to come to their own conclusions rather than judging the conclusion early, that they make. This will allow me to work within a team more effectively. Understanding roles within a team is important, however working within a team in other role outside of my ‘comfort zone’ will allow better and deeper understanding of how the team can be better equipped for the future.</p>"+

"<h4>Seemy personality test</h4>" +
"<p>The results of this test, shown below in the provided extract, are in my opinion like horoscopes, mass application to many. However, with the various results the following could be extrapolated, the test will influence me in that I will need to accommodate others understanding, allowing other to come to their own conclusions rather than judging the conclusion early that they make. This will allow me to work within a team more effectively. Understanding roles within a team is important, however working within a team in other roles outside of my ‘comfort zone’ will allow better and deeper understanding of how the team can be better equipped for the future. I have learned that not all online tests are made equally.</p>"+

"<h4>123 test disc personality test</h4>" +
"<p>The results of this test were not very accurate representation of me, it allows me to understand my view of the world against others, but I believe the test is not accurate. Using tests such as these could be detrimental to you if you followed them explicitly. The test will influence me in that I will need to accommodate others understanding, allowing other to come to their own conclusions rather than judging the conclusion early that they make. This will allow me to work within a team more effectively.

"<h1>Ideal career Career Position</h1>" + 
"<p>My ideal role would be Chief Digital Officer and follows on from my current role of Chief Technical Engineer ANZ. This role is the next evolutionary step in my career, having worked within this field for 25+ years my knowledge and understanding across multiple sectors at a global level is consummate to this role. This position provides me with the level of influence to develop global frameworks rather than national or country level frameworks. It allows access to additional resources and skills to enable cohesive ideas and technology solutions to come together to solve complex engineering problems. This solving of complex problems is one of the driving forces of choosing this career path.</p>"+
"<p>The skills and qualifications in this role have more to do with experience and exposure to the type of work involved, soft skills in how I present, articulate arguments and leadership in direction for technology solutions. It is however better to have qualifications which support the experience, and therefore why I am trying to achieve a degree in IT.</P>"+
"<p>In summary the skills and qualifications required may consist of:</P>"+
"<ol>"+
"<li>Background in IT and/or Engineering (20+years)</li>"+
