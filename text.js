"<p>The results of this test were relatively accurate, it allows me to understand my view of the world against others. This in turn allows me to interact and see the social interactions I have viewed from a different person and adjust as required to accommodate the connection. The test will influence me in that I will need to accommodate others understanding, allowing other to come to their own conclusions rather than judging the conclusion early, that they make. This will allow me to work within a team more effectively. Understanding roles within a team is important, however working within a team in other role outside of my ‘comfort zone’ will allow better and deeper understanding of how the team can be better equipped for the future.</p>"+

"<p>John’s results, specifically the Miers-Briggs test placed John as an INFJ personality type, John contributions towards the team are indicated within the tests are being able to provide, insight and unorthodox thinking. This combined with the ability to form simple strategy from complexity provides the team with valuable angles of attack towards the tasks required. Johns' personality type is open-minded but has a sense of responsibility to the team. John is also conscientious and is agreeable towards other ideas and thoughts, understanding the inner dynamics of a team, this helps the teamwork together, yet John provides leadership where it's required with a steady and controlled empathy to others within the team.

According to ACS Australia’s Digital Pulse (2022), there has reportedly been an 8.0% growth in technology related employment in Australia. In comparison, there has been a 6.4% growth in overall jobs. This means that as of 2021, there are 870,268 people who are employed in the technology workforce. Current projections suggest that there will be 1 million technology workers in Australia by 2024 and 1.2 million by 2027. While the technology industry is growing overall in Australia, some occupations are growing more rapidly than others. Taking into consideration what skills are in high demand is beneficial to those who are looking to go into the industry. These skills are applied to IT specific related skills as well as general skills.

"<p><b>Conclusion</b>: Concerning demand, the skills listed in the group’s previous assignments are seen through the general skills section more than the IT Specific skills section. The most in demand IT Specific skills are related to programming-oriented occupations, similar to the findings in the job rankings section. It should be noted, however, that only showing the ranking of the “top three” skills does not fully grasp the entirety of skills that are in demand or becoming increasingly sought after.</p>"+

"<p>Ben: My opinion of my ideal job has not necessarily changed but this data analysis has made me more aware of the growth in the area of data science and the management of data. The skills that I imagined would be most in demand across the IT industry (based on the Kangaroo’s ideal job selection) were in line with my expectations. Having these data summarised has had the great benefit of highlighting the key focus areas of what skills (both hard and soft skills) are most in demand with employers. As a result, I will be tailoring my self-directed learning to focus more on the SQL and database knowledge, and I will make a concerted effort to improve both my written and verbal communication skills in preparation for entering the IT workforce. </p>"+
"<p>John: </p>"+
"<p>Nicole: For the ideal job section of assignment one, I was unsure of what I would consider my ideal job. For this reason, I am remaining open minded and researching the current job outlook in Australia has been an interesting venture. I want to take time to further consider what my ideal job would be. During the remainder of my studies, I will be sure to keep in mind what areas I will benefit from and use the resources provided to make the most of my knowledge.</p>"+

"<p>Integrated circuits, computer-based boards and peripherals were notoriously expensive and non-modular creating complex development environments and accessibility issues for the general population. The advent of modularised computer-based systems allowed reduced cost of manufacture and increased accessibility which in turn allowed increased development opportunities both in hardware and software. Raspberry Pis brought a small, modularised PC to the general public at low cost and using this methodology it allowed everyday users to develop products and applications without the complexity of commercial level development boards. It also allowed people from all over the world access to powerful low-cost computer-based technologies both for development and general use. Later, again due to the low-cost element and modularisation, it allowed educational entities the ability to teach students at any age, the fundamental elements of hardware and software development. Additional reading on the history of the Rasberry Pi is available on many web pages, however a short and concise text is 'The Epic Story of the Rasberry Pi' from https://raspberrytips.com/raspberry-pi-history/.Please refer to References section. </p>" +
"<p>Both raspberry Pi and adreno technologies, or more accurately, the manufacturers of these products have allowed the public access to development boards for product development. While this is a major step forward it also has issues because while these boards are cheap, commercial development into a consumer product would be considerably and preventatively expensive, most manufacturers would use the development board to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and then scale the circuitry / hardware to make it commercially viable. This is beyond the capabilities of a hobbyist or someone in the general population and requires teams who can navigate the legal requirements of product development but also ensuring that the product meets standards across multiple countries, an example of this, would be EMC and CE marking for regulatory compliance for a particular country. While the Adrino and Rasberry Pi boards have passed these tests its important that the tests include its intended environment as part of those compliance regulations. </p>"+
"<p>The advantages however, enabled by these development boards allow people within the general population at both a professional and hobbyist level to learn and experiment with new concepts and ideas that without such technology would not be possible and would require sophisticated developers with bespoke development boards being created as they were in the past.  </p>"+
"<p>Due to the reduced costs of PC manufacture and Integrated Circuits (IC’s) in general and the modulization of communication protocols used generally (blue tooth, Wi-Fi etc) it is now possible to build hardware which can be thought of as “lego” expanding or reducing the main board to accommodate your application. This lends itself to small modular IC’s which perform complex functions as part of the hardware configuration and provides less development requirements for each modular element, this has been mirrored with programming languages that support these technologies in general. Languages such as C++, Python also work on modular or containerised scripts and programmes that others have developed which you are able to use within your application through the open-source licensing agreements. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license </p>"+
"<p>These elements combined provide the general population with the ability to develop very complex applications at virtually no cost. The future of this modularised concept allows us access to newer technologies such as IoT, machine learning and artificial intelligence which can be incorporated into complex hardware such as robots or self-driving cars as an example. This increasing to provide us with plug and play technologies both in hardware and software allows not just one individual to develop applications or concepts but the entire population, it is not uncommon for groups of likeminded individuals from around the world contributing to a common application, this brining substantial innovation benefits. The future, generally, is more focused on the understanding of combining all these technologies rather than development of the technology itself.  </p>"+
"<p>In the next 3 years the plug and play element or simplification of complex integrated circuits as part of expansion of the main adreno or Raspberry Pi board will become more prevalent, and less understanding will be required of the under lying technologies to develop your application. Currently this technology does not need you to understand the inner working of a 12C Communications protocol, but more how to wire the hardware using breadboards and then control the data with programming because if it did you would need additional hardware, oscilloscopes, and such things. The software element is becoming more important to understand than the hardware itself, and due to the complexities of programming in the past, newer programming languages or higher-level languages are becoming dominant, Python being a good example of this, which is accessibly to anyone with a PC and is being taught at schools and education facilities all over the world today. </p>"+
"<p>It is unlikely that Raspberry Pi’s or Adreno boards will be used in a commercial setting due to the cost of development, however, the effects of the masses having access to this technology and it being taught it in education facilities is interesting because many of the commercially developed products on the market both in hardware and software are using the same pattern and this can be seen in the use of python for the development of IoT sensors on the market now, additionally python is also used in the development of modelling software and AI technologies. The ability of people to interact with commercial products via API’s is becoming a significant development across multiple industries, this in turn is driving further demand for adreno / raspberry pi technologies for people to learn and develop on. Technologies which are built on non-modularised and old development boards and programming languages which people don’t’ understand anymore will become obsolete and this newer technology will replace them. This is because generally, bespoke, or highly complex technologies which require support become very expensive when compared to a modularised system. This will make it commercially unviable for those older systems. </p>"+
"<p>The affects to me personally would be negligible because I do not produce products within my career, those that do, would also not be directly affected if they are following a similar pattern of development as discussed above. It does however open newer possibilities for engineers, hobbyists and people working within the IT industry to gain in-depth understanding of the technologies that these boards offer more fundamentally though, it allows significant access to innovation and creativity due to its broad spectrum of users. The affect to business could be that the business IT needs to enable its staff access to these technologies allowing development of supporting software that the business uses. This would allow them to communicate with business level technologies and commercially produced technologies such as IoT devices, this will be done via the Application Programming Interface (API) available across nearly every product that businesses use today.</p>"+
"<p>This technology brings programming and software development to a much younger audience. It will allow many children to have interactions with programming as entertainment which is something that was not available in the past. </p>"+

"<h2>Cyber security</h2>" +
"<p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and devices from digital attacks, theft, and damage. It involves implementing measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems. As our reliance on technology has grown, it has become easier for cybercriminals to access sensitive information and disrupt critical systems. Cybersecurity measures such as firewalls, antivirus software, and secure protocols are used to prevent unauthorised access to networks, devices, and data, to protect against viruses, malware, and other types of threats. Cybersecurity is important because it helps to prevent data breaches, identity theft, and other types of cyber-attacks that can have serious consequences for individuals, businesses, and governments. This field is constantly evolving, so it is important to stay up to date with the latest best practices and technologies to keep systems and data secure.</p>"+
"<p>As almost everything digitalised now significant steps need to be taken to improve the security of data, PII and other sensitive information that is stored on digital hardware. There are several ways to improve cybersecurity in all industries. Implementing strong, unique passwords and regularly updating them is one effective way to protect against unauthorised access. Adding an extra layer of security through two-factor authentication also known as multifactor authentication (MFA) can also help. MFA involves the use of at least two different authentication components, such as something you know (e.g. a password), something you have (e.g. a security token or a smartphone), or something you are (e.g. a fingerprint or facial recognition). It is important to keep software and systems up to date with the latest security patches and updates to prevent vulnerabilities within your organisation from being exploited. Training employees on cybersecurity best practices and using encryption for sensitive data can also help reduce the risk of an attack. Regular security assessments and having a response plan to cybersecurity incidents can also help mitigate the damage and minimise the impact of an attack. It's important for organisations to take a proactive approach to cybersecurity, rather than waiting until an attack occurs before acting. By staying vigilant and taking steps to prevent attacks, organisations or individuals can better protect themselves and their customers from cyber threats.</p>"+
"<p>There are several technologies currently used in the cybersecurity industry to protect against cyber threats. The most used software-based technology that can be highlighted is the Anti-virus and anti-malware software that are designed to detect and remove malware, such as viruses, worms, and Trojan horses, from computers and devices. Firewalls are network security systems that control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules and are utilised by almost all corporation from big to small. Another significant tech used in the industry is the Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) that help monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity and block or alert on any suspicious activity. Encryption is the process of converting plain text into coded text that can only be read by someone with the correct decryption key. Identity and access management (IAM) systems are designed to manage and protect the identities of users and devices within an organisation, including managing login credentials and controlling access to resources based on user permissions. Network segmentation the practice of dividing a computer network into smaller sub-networks, or segments, in order to limit the spread of a cyber threat. A technology I utilise daily is a Virtual private network (VPNs) this is used to create a secure, encrypted connection between a device and a network, allowing users to access the network securely over the internet. Security information and event management (SIEM) systems collect and analyse security-related data from multiple sources in order to identify and respond to potential cyber threats. This technology Is particularly useful for large cooperations with a complex network and provides a more centralised platform in order respond to security events and alerts. Finally, Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning can be used to analyse large amounts of data and identify patterns that may indicate a cyber threat, allowing organisations to take proactive measures to prevent attacks. To sum it up, there are lots of different technologies out there that people and companies can use. Even though these technologies are advanced, they must keep changing and improving to keep up with new threats that are always emerging.</p>"+
"<p>In the future, we can expect to see the increasing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify and prevent cyber threats in real-time. There will also be a greater focus on securing data and applications in the cloud as the use of cloud computing grows. To protect against the potential threat of quantum computers breaking current encryption methods, there will likely be a greater focus on developing and adopting quantum-resistant technologies. Traditional authentication methods such as passwords are becoming increasingly vulnerable to attacks, so we may see a greater focus on using biometric authentication methods like fingerprints, facial recognition, and iris scans to provide an additional layer of security. As the threat landscape continues to evolve, it is important for individuals and organisations to stay up-to-date on the latest cybersecurity threats and best practices, so there may be a greater emphasis on cybersecurity education and training to help individuals and organisations stay informed and protect against cyber threats.</p>"+
"<p>Cybersecurity impacts the average person in multiple ways. It is important for protecting personal information (PII) and financial information from being accessed or stolen by unauthorised bad actors. If an individual's personal information is accessed or stolen, it can be used for identity theft, which can have serious consequences including financial losses and damage to an individual. Cybersecurity is also important for protecting against fraudulent activities such as phishing scams, which can trick individuals into revealing personal information or installing malware on their devices. If an individual's accounts are hacked, they may lose access to these accounts and the information and resources associated with them. Cybersecurity is also important for protecting an individual's privacy, as it helps prevent unauthorised access to personal information or data. To protect ourselves from these risks, it is important for us to be aware of cybersecurity risks and take steps to protect themselves, such as using strong and unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and keeping software and devices up to date. On a personal level I’m a big advocate on the former practices and urge all my friends and family to follow suit.</p>"+

Some of the potential impacts of these developments include the following. Improved decision-making, machine learning algorithms can analyse large amounts of data and identify patterns that may be difficult for humans to understand. This can help organisations make more informed decisions, such as by predicting customer behaviour or identifying fraudulent activity. Enhanced productivity, machine learning can automate many tasks that are currently done manually, freeing up time for humans to focus on higher-level tasks. This can lead to increased productivity and efficiency. Improved healthcare, machine learning can be used to analyse medical data and identify patterns that may be useful for diagnosis and treatment. It can also be used to predict patient outcomes and identify potential health issues before they become serious. Overall, the potential impact of machine learning is significant and wide-ranging. It has the potential to transform many aspects of our lives, and it will be interesting to see how it is used in the coming years to solve a wide range of problems and improve our daily lives.</p>"+
"<p>The impact of machine learning on jobs and technologies is a complex and multifaceted issue. On the one hand, machine learning has the potential to automate certain tasks that are currently done by humans, which could lead to job displacement. However, it also has the potential to create new job opportunities, such as for data scientists and machine learning engineers. In terms of technologies, machine learning has the potential to replace certain existing technologies or augment them in ways that make them more efficient or effective. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to analyse and interpret data in real-time, enabling faster and more accurate decision-making. This could lead to the replacement of certain existing technologies that are currently used for these tasks. Overall, it is difficult to predict exactly how machine learning will impact the job market and the use of certain technologies. It is likely that it will have both disruptive and transformative effects, and it will be important for individuals and organisations to adapt and stay up to date with these developments. It is also important to consider the ethical implications of these changes and ensure that they are implemented in a responsible and fair manner.</p>"+
"<p>Machine learning has the potential to transform many aspects of our daily lives and the lives of our families. It can be used to improve healthcare outcomes, enhance customer service, automate tasks, and improve decision-making. These changes are likely to lead to increased productivity and efficiency, as well as a higher quality of life for individuals and their families. While there may be some disruptions as machine learning is adopted and integrated into various industries and sectors, the overall impact is expected to be positive and transformative.</p>"
