"<p>The results of this test were relatively accurate, it allows me to understand my view of the world against others. This in turn allows me to interact and see the social interactions I have viewed from a different person and adjust as required to accommodate the connection. The test will influence me in that I will need to accommodate others understanding, allowing other to come to their own conclusions rather than judging the conclusion early, that they make. This will allow me to work within a team more effectively. Understanding roles within a team is important, however working within a team in other role outside of my ‘comfort zone’ will allow better and deeper understanding of how the team can be better equipped for the future.</p>"+

"<p>John’s results, specifically the Miers-Briggs test placed John as an INFJ personality type, John contributions towards the team are indicated within the tests are being able to provide, insight and unorthodox thinking. This combined with the ability to form simple strategy from complexity provides the team with valuable angles of attack towards the tasks required. Johns' personality type is open-minded but has a sense of responsibility to the team. John is also conscientious and is agreeable towards other ideas and thoughts, understanding the inner dynamics of a team, this helps the teamwork together, yet John provides leadership where it's required with a steady and controlled empathy to others within the team. This is reflective across all three tests as can be seen within the graphics. </p>"+

"<h2>Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices</h2>" +
"<p>Integrated circuits, computer-based boards and peripherals were notoriously expensive and non-modular creating complex development environments and accessibility issues for the general population. The advent of modularised computer-based systems allowed reduced cost of manufacture and increased accessibility which in turn allowed increased development opportunities both in hardware and software. Raspberry Pis brought a small, modularised PC to the general public at low cost and using this methodology it allowed everyday users to develop products and applications without the complexity of commercial level development boards. It also allowed people from all over the world access to powerful low-cost computer-based technologies both for development and general use. Later, again due to the low-cost element and modularisation, it allowed educational entities the ability to teach students at any age, the fundamental elements of hardware and software development. Additional reading on the history of the Rasberry Pi is available on many web pages, however a short and concise text is 'The Epic Story of the Rasberry Pi' from https://raspberrytips.com/raspberry-pi-history/.Please refer to References section. </p>" +
"<p>Both raspberry Pi and adreno technologies, or more accurately, the manufacturers of these products have allowed the public access to development boards for product development. While this is a major step forward it also has issues because while these boards are cheap, commercial development into a consumer product would be considerably and preventatively expensive, most manufacturers would use the development board to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and then scale the circuitry / hardware to make it commercially viable. This is beyond the capabilities of a hobbyist or someone in the general population and requires teams who can navigate the legal requirements of product development but also ensuring that the product meets standards across multiple countries, an example of this, would be EMC and CE marking for regulatory compliance for a particular country. While the Adrino and Rasberry Pi boards have passed these tests its important that the tests include its intended environment as part of those compliance regulations. </p>"+
"<p>The advantages however, enabled by these development boards allow people within the general population at both a professional and hobbyist level to learn and experiment with new concepts and ideas that without such technology would not be possible and would require sophisticated developers with bespoke development boards being created as they were in the past.  </p>"+
"<p>Due to the reduced costs of PC manufacture and Integrated Circuits (IC’s) in general and the modulization of communication protocols used generally (blue tooth, Wi-Fi etc) it is now possible to build hardware which can be thought of as “lego” expanding or reducing the main board to accommodate your application. This lends itself to small modular IC’s which perform complex functions as part of the hardware configuration and provides less development requirements for each modular element, this has been mirrored with programming languages that support these technologies in general. Languages such as C++, Python also work on modular or containerised scripts and programmes that others have developed which you are able to use within your application through the open-source licensing agreements. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license </p>"+
"<p>These elements combined provide the general population with the ability to develop very complex applications at virtually no cost. The future of this modularised concept allows us access to newer technologies such as IoT, machine learning and artificial intelligence which can be incorporated into complex hardware such as robots or self-driving cars as an example. This increasing to provide us with plug and play technologies both in hardware and software allows not just one individual to develop applications or concepts but the entire population, it is not uncommon for groups of likeminded individuals from around the world contributing to a common application, this brining substantial innovation benefits. The future, generally, is more focused on the understanding of combining all these technologies rather than development of the technology itself.  </p>"+
"<p>In the next 3 years the plug and play element or simplification of complex integrated circuits as part of expansion of the main adreno or Raspberry Pi board will become more prevalent, and less understanding will be required of the under lying technologies to develop your application. Currently this technology does not need you to understand the inner working of a 12C Communications protocol, but more how to wire the hardware using breadboards and then control the data with programming because if it did you would need additional hardware, oscilloscopes, and such things. The software element is becoming more important to understand than the hardware itself, and due to the complexities of programming in the past, newer programming languages or higher-level languages are becoming dominant, Python being a good example of this, which is accessibly to anyone with a PC and is being taught at schools and education facilities all over the world today. </p>"+
"<p>It is unlikely that Raspberry Pi’s or Adreno boards will be used in a commercial setting due to the cost of development, however, the effects of the masses having access to this technology and it being taught it in education facilities is interesting because many of the commercially developed products on the market both in hardware and software are using the same pattern and this can be seen in the use of python for the development of IoT sensors on the market now, additionally python is also used in the development of modelling software and AI technologies. The ability of people to interact with commercial products via API’s is becoming a significant development across multiple industries, this in turn is driving further demand for adreno / raspberry pi technologies for people to learn and develop on. Technologies which are built on non-modularised and old development boards and programming languages which people don’t’ understand anymore will become obsolete and this newer technology will replace them. This is because generally, bespoke, or highly complex technologies which require support become very expensive when compared to a modularised system. This will make it commercially unviable for those older systems. </p>"+
"<p>The affects to me personally would be negligible because I do not produce products within my career, those that do, would also not be directly affected if they are following a similar pattern of development as discussed above. It does however open newer possibilities for engineers, hobbyists and people working within the IT industry to gain in-depth understanding of the technologies that these boards offer more fundamentally though, it allows significant access to innovation and creativity due to its broad spectrum of users. The affect to business could be that the business IT needs to enable its staff access to these technologies allowing development of supporting software that the business uses. This would allow them to communicate with business level technologies and commercially produced technologies such as IoT devices, this will be done via the Application Programming Interface (API) available across nearly every product that businesses use today.</p>"+
"<p>This technology brings programming and software development to a much younger audience. It will allow many children to have interactions with programming as entertainment which is something that was not available in the past. </p>"+
